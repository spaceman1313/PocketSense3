Python3 implementation of PocketSense OFX handling scripts

This is a Python3 implementation of the PocketSense scripts developed by Robert and found here:

The initial 3.0.beta release is a pure translation of the original scripts.  My long term
intent is to refactor and modularize some of the code to make it easier to implement
additional changes.  In the development pipeline is the incorporation of other available
CSV to OFX scripts.  This will allow users to continue using OFX functionality in Microsoft
Money and other legacy accounting systems even as more banks discontinue the use of OFX.

I can be reached at pocketsense3 at the usual g email system.
