# OFX.DISCOVERCARD.COM
#   1.  Discover OFX files will contain transaction identifiers w/ the following format:
#           FITIDYYYYMMDDamt#####, where
#                FITID  = string literal
#                YYYY   = year (numeric)
#                MM     = month (numeric)
#                DD     = day (numeric)
#                amt    = dollar amount of the transaction, including a hypen for negative entries (e.g., -24.95)
#                #####  = 5 digit serial number

#   2.  The 5-digit serial number can change each time you connect to the server,
#          meaning that the same transaction can download with different FITID numbers.
#       That's not good, since Money requires a unique FITID value for each valid transaction.
#       Varying serial numbers result in duplicate transactions!

#   3.  We'll replace the 5-digit serial number with one of our own.
#       The default will be 0 for every transaction,
#          and we'll increment by one for each subsequent transaction that that matches
#          a previous transaction in the file.

# 8/14/2016: Discover BANK now uses an FITID format of SDF######, where ###### is unique for the day.
#            The length seems to vary, but the largest observed is 6 digits
#            Unfortunately, the digits can be assigned to multiple transactions on the same day, so it isn't
#               guaranteed to be unique.
#            Modified routine to uniquely handle BASTMT vs CCSTMT statements.

# NOTE:  There was brief period in late 2017 where Discover Bank changed their fitid format, but soon
#        reverted to the same as described above.
